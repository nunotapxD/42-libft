# 42-libft

This is the code for the libft library, a collection of custom-written C functions that are commonly used in many projects. The library includes functions for string manipulation, memory allocation, and linked list management, among others.

The code is divided into three parts: Part 1, Part 2, and Bonus.

## Instructions
To compile the code, run `make` in the terminal. This will create a library called `libft.a`.

To compile the bonus functions, run `make bonus`. This will add the bonus functions to the library.

To clean the object files and library, run `make clean` and `make fclean`, respectively.

The library is accompanied by a header file called libft.h, which contains prototypes for all the functions in the library. To use the library in your project, include the header file and link to the library as described above.
